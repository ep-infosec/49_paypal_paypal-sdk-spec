## Loading the Client SDK

There are two ways you can load the client side SDK:

1. You can add it in a script tag on the page.

Sample Code:
```html
<script src="https://www.paypal.com/sdk/js?client-id=<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>" />
```

```js
window.paypal.Buttons().render('#paypal-buttons-container');
```

2. You can install as a module from npm.

Sample Code:
```sh
npm install @paypal/paypal-js
```

```js
import { loadScript } from "paypal";

const configuration = {
  clientID: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
};

try {
  const paypal = await loadScript(configuration)
} catch(error) {
  console.error(error);
}

paypal.Buttons().render('#paypal-buttons-container');
```

## Validation
Once the above code has been run you should see the `#paypal-buttons-container` populated with an iframe containing the button stack. Clicking on a button will launch a popup window for the checkout flow.

## Troubleshooting
If you do not see visibile buttons on the screen then ensure your clientID is correct and that you are loading the sdk script from the proper environment.

Typical error cases are:
1. You are using the wrong clientID or you are using a clientID in the incorrect environment
2. You misspelled or made a mistakes in query params. For example you may have made a typo in a component name
3. Server side error generating the script file which would require remediation by the engineering team.
